# Tile-Based Memory Game
### GUI made using Tkinter

A simple tile-based matching memory game where tiles appear on a screen for a brief period of time,
and then disappear. The objective is to click on all the tiles that were originally shaded to the
best of your ability. This version features three modes that vary in size and difficulty, a timer,
and a customizable mode.
